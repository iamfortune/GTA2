part of what of i wanted to do GTA to do was to automatically add a date input as soon a user clicks on input, that you add your goals and also add a date/time to it.

sadly, i have not been able to get the algorithm correct. 

if you'd contribute to this, in whatever way or language, i'd be so happy to see how you did it.
